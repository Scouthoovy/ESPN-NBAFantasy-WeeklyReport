# ESPN Fantasy Basketball Weekly Report
Python script for generating cool and interesting weekly stats for my private Fantasy Basketball league of size 10. The script takes advantage of cwedt94's ESPN Fantasy API.

It makes use of Google Colab, where I create the Python scripts to generate the stat trackers, and Power BI to display the information visually.
